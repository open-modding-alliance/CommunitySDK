# 📚 Community SDK
This is our effort to bridge the gap between the official Giants Developer Network and the knowledge spread throughout the FS modding community. Sort of an FS modding knowledgebase and FS LUA Reference Library.

- ⚙️ **[Script Library](https://github.com/open-modding-alliance/ScriptLibrary)** ([install](https://github.com/open-modding-alliance/ScriptLibrary?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) | documentation)
- 🧰 **FS Build tool** (install | documentation)
- 🎁 **[Bootstrap Mod](https://github.com/open-modding-alliance/BootstrapMod)** (download)


## 📚 **[LUA Reference Library](https://github.com/open-modding-alliance/CommunitySDK)**
  - Script Bindings
  - Undocumented functions
  - Global Tables
  - Known Classes


## 🧙 **Productivity tips & guides**
- **Configure your IDE/text editor** - tips and guides to make you more efficient when working with your mods, especially the XML and Lua parts
  - TBD
- **[Can-I-Use-It?](Can-I-Use-It.md)** _(in-game vs Giants Editor vs Lua stand-alone)_
    - Table with an overview of the Lua functions and tables that might no be accessible in-game, in Giants Editor or the native Lua interpreter.
